# ‚úÖ Supabase Setup Complete!

Your construction management app is now fully connected to Supabase!

## What Was Set Up

### ‚úÖ Database Schema Created
All tables have been successfully created in your Supabase database:
- **users** - Team members with hourly rates and clock-in status
- **projects** - Construction projects with budgets and status
- **tasks** - Project tasks with assignees and due dates
- **time_logs** - Time tracking with location and cost calculation
- **punch_list_items** - Project punch list items
- **project_photos** - Project documentation photos

### ‚úÖ Database Features Enabled
- UUID primary keys for all records
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- Permissive policies for development (all operations allowed)
- Database indexes for query performance
- Automatic `updated_at` timestamps via triggers

### ‚úÖ Configuration Files
- **`.env`** - Contains your Supabase credentials (secured in `.gitignore`)
- **`supabase/config.ts`** - Supabase client configuration with your credentials
- **`hooks/useDataContext.ts`** - Fully integrated with Supabase for all data operations

### ‚úÖ Type System Updated
- All IDs converted from `number` to `string` (UUID compatible)
- TypeScript types updated throughout the application
- Full type safety maintained

## Your Supabase Project

- **Project URL:** `https://ohuwypfbomkqwtzjzpws.supabase.co`
- **Project Ref:** `ohuwypfbomkqwtzjzpws`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Ready to use

## Next Steps

### 1. Start Your Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test the Integration
Once the app starts:
- Add a team member - it will save to Supabase
- Create a project - it will persist in the database
- Add tasks and track time - all data is stored in Supabase
- Add photos and punch list items - everything persists!

### 3. View Your Data
You can view your data directly in the Supabase dashboard:
- Go to https://app.supabase.com
- Select your project
- Click "Table Editor" to see all your data

## Security Note

‚ö†Ô∏è **Production Recommendations:**

1. **Update RLS Policies** - The current policies allow all operations. For production:
   - Implement proper authentication
   - Add role-based access control
   - Restrict who can read/write data

2. **Fix Security Advisory** - Address the function search path warning:
   - Go to SQL Editor in Supabase
   - Update the `update_updated_at_column()` function to set `SECURITY DEFINER`

3. **Environment Variables** - Never commit your `.env` file
   - Already added to `.gitignore` ‚úÖ
   - Use environment-specific keys for production

## Features Now Live

üéâ All data operations now use Supabase:

- ‚úÖ **User Management** - Create and manage team members
- ‚úÖ **Project Management** - Full CRUD for projects
- ‚úÖ **Task Tracking** - Assign and track project tasks
- ‚úÖ **Time Tracking** - Clock in/out with GPS location
- ‚úÖ **Punch Lists** - Track project completion items
- ‚úÖ **Photo Management** - Store project documentation photos

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check `.env` file exists** in the project root
2. **Verify credentials** are correct (they're in your `.env` file)
3. **Restart dev server** after environment changes
4. **Check browser console** for Supabase connection errors
