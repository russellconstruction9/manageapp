# Multi-Company Setup Status

## ✅ What's Been Completed

### Database Schema
- ✅ Created `companies` table
- ✅ Added `company_id` to `users` table
- ✅ Added `company_id` to `projects` table
- ✅ Updated RLS policies for company-based isolation

### Type System
- ✅ Added `Company` interface to types.ts
- ✅ Added `companyId` field to `User` interface
- ✅ Added `companyId` field to `Project` interface

## ⚠️ What Still Needs to Be Done

### Data Context Updates
The `useDataContext.ts` file needs to be updated to:
1. Load companies on mount
2. Filter users/projects by selected company
3. Add `company_id` when creating new users/projects
4. Add `addCompany` function
5. Handle company switching

### UI Components
Need to add:
1. Company selector/switcher component
2. Company creation modal
3. Update user creation to include company selection
4. Update project creation to include company selection

## Current State

**The database is ready for multi-company**, but the application layer still needs updates to fully utilize it. The current implementation will work with all data visible to all users (not company-scoped).

## Next Steps

1. Complete the data context updates for company filtering
2. Add company management UI
3. Test multi-tenant isolation
4. Consider adding authentication for proper company association
