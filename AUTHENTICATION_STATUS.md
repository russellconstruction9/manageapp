# Authentication Status

## ❌ NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

Authentication is **not currently set up** for this application.

## Current State

### What Exists
- ✅ Supabase database connection
- ✅ Custom `users` table for team members
- ✅ UserSwitcher component (for switching team member context)
- ✅ Database is ready for auth integration

### What's Missing
- ❌ Login/Sign up pages
- ❌ Supabase Authentication integration
- ❌ Protected routes
- ❌ Session management
- ❌ Password reset functionality
- ❌ Email verification
- ❌ Linking authenticated users to companies

## Why This Matters

Without authentication:
- Anyone can access the app if they have the URL
- No way to secure user accounts
- No way to track who made changes
- No proper user sessions
- Companies can't be properly secured

## Recommended Next Steps

I can implement:

1. **Supabase Auth Integration** - Full login/signup system
2. **Protected Routes** - Require login to access the app
3. **User-Company Linking** - Link authenticated users to their company
4. **Session Persistence** - Keep users logged in
5. **Role-Based Access** - Admin/manager/worker roles within companies

Would you like me to implement authentication now?
