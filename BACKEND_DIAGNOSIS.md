# Backend Diagnosis - Project Data Issues

## What's Actually Happening

### ✅ Data IS Being Saved
- Projects are being saved to the database successfully
- Example: Project "Sfg" is in the database with company_id "da5bebc7-e5de-4c02-95f7-a9d6e1fb1a8f"
- Companies are being created: "My Company" and "R2"

### ❌ Issues Found

1. **No Data Filtering by Company**
   - The app loads ALL projects from all companies
   - Projects are not filtered by the current selected company
   - This means you see projects from all companies mixed together

2. **Company Context Issues**
   - Multiple companies exist in database
   - App doesn't properly filter data by current company
   - New projects might be created for different companies

3. **Data Loading**
   - Data loads on mount but doesn't refresh after adding
   - No automatic refresh after data changes

## Current Database State

**Companies:**
- My Company (id: a0bc4ac5-2403-4dfd-b52b-030736f44846)
- R2 (id: da5bebc7-e5de-4c02-95f7-a9d6e1fb1a8f)

**Projects:**
- "Sfg" (company: R2)

## Root Causes

1. Projects ARE saving to database ✅
2. But they may not show because:
   - Wrong company selected
   - Data not being loaded properly
   - No refresh after save

## Next Steps to Fix

1. Add company filtering to data loading
2. Add data refresh after insert operations
3. Fix company context management
4. Add better error handling and logging
